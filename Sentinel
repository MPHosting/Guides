to install the Sentinel software.

Let's start with the required software:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git python-virtualenv

When the software is installed, we need to step into the .muecore folder to proceed with the installatin of the Sentinel software:

cd /home/mue/.muecore
git clone https://github.com/muecoin/sentinel.git
cd sentinel

step 3) create virtual python environment

virtualenv venv

(if this command fails try installing this package

sudo apt-get install -y virtualenv

step 4) install sentinel dependencies

venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

step 5) test sentinel is alive and talking to the still sync'ing wallet

venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py

You should see: "mued not synced with network! Awaiting full sync before running Sentinel."
This is exactly what we want to see at this stage

step 6) wait until the reindex has complete and the wallet has synced

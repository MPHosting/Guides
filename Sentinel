to install the Sentinel software.

Let's start with the required software:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git python-virtualenv

When the software is installed, we need to step into the .muecore folder to proceed with the installatin of the Sentinel software:

cd /home/mue/.muecore
git clone https://github.com/muecoin/sentinel.git
cd sentinel

step 3) create virtual python environment

virtualenv venv

(if this command fails try installing this package

sudo apt-get install -y virtualenv

step 4) install sentinel dependencies

venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

step 5) test sentinel is alive and talking to the still sync'ing wallet

venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py

You should see: "mued not synced with network! Awaiting full sync before running Sentinel."
This is exactly what we want to see at this stage

step 6) wait until the reindex has complete and the wallet has synced

step 7) start your masternode

At this point, your remote masternode is synchronized and chatting with the network
but is not accepted as a masternode because it hasn't been introduced to the network
by your collateral. 

Go back to your local wallet, open the debug console, and run these commands:

walletpassphrase <YOURPASSPHRASE> 120
masternode start-alias <MNALIAS>

to start your masternode.


step 8) test sentinel has nothing to say

You're needed back in Sentinel directory! 

cd sentinel

At this point, running

venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py

should return nothing but silence. This is how you know it's working.

step 9) create a crontab entry to wake sentinel every five minutes

crontab -e

Choose nano as your editor. Add this line to the end of the file.

* * * * * cd /home/mue/.muecore/sentinel && ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py 2>&1 >> sentinel-cron.log


Make sure you:
1) Change USERNAME to your username.
2) Hit enter to create another line at the end after this line, or the file will not work.

Press ctrl w to save and ctrl x exit.

step 10) check for start, try, try, again

cd /home/USERNAME/.muecore
